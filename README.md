This mod adds a couple blocks to the game.

Originally built for 1.14.4 and ported upwards.

Inspired by the Elevator Block from [OpenBlocks](https://ftbwiki.org/Elevator_(OpenBlocks))

### Blocks

* Endervator Block
  - While standing on this block, you can jump to go up or sneak to go down
  - It will search for another endervator block within the maximum distance to teleport the player to.
* Ender Pearl Block
  - This block allows compression of enderpearls at 9:1
  - With so many enderpearls in one location, it's a bit unstable. Be careful when touching or interacting with this block.
